** Description **

The inotify API provides a mechanism for monitoring file system events. 
Inotify can be used to monitor individual files, or to monitor directories.
When a directory is monitored, inotify will return events for the directory 
itself, and for files inside the directory. 

** Limitations and caveats (from the C docs) **

Inotify monitoring of directories is not recursive: to monitor 
subdirectories under a directory, additional watches must be created. 
This can take a significant amount time for large directory trees.

The inotify API provides no information about the user or process that 
triggered the inotify event.

Note that the event queue can overflow. In this case, events are lost.
Robust applications should handle the possibility of lost events gracefully.

The inotify API identifies affected files by filename. However, by the time
an application processes an inotify event, the filename may already have
been deleted or renamed.

If monitoring an entire directory subtree, and a new subdirectory is created
in that tree, be aware that by the time you create a watch for the new 
subdirectory, new files may already have been created in the subdirectory.
Therefore, you may want to scan the contents of the subdirectory immediately
after adding the watch.
